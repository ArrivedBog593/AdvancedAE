* New Feature:
  - You can now color your Quantum Armor!
    - This feature can be accessed from the style config button located on the top right corner of the quantum armor config screen.
    - You can select a color from the color picker or use a hex code
    - You can apply colors individually or different colors for each armor piece
    - The inventory slots for the armor pieces were moved to the other side of the screen to prevent tooltips from covering the screen's content

* Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed quantum armor screen sliders not working correctly when being dragged

* Crash Fixes:
  - Fixed a bug where the mod would crash a server instance on load
