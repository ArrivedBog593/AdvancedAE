# New Features:
- Completely reworked Quantum Computer multiblock render/textures!
- Added the Quantum Crafter Terminal alongside the companion wireless version
- Reworked how the Stock Export Bus keeps track of contents in target inventories, it now works even if the target inventory can't be imported from.
- Added the Advanced IO Bus. A mixture of the Stock Export Bus and the Import Export Bus, it does everything the others do, but it will also regulate exports (extract what exceeds the stock amount) and it is 8 times faster than all export buses!
- Added a config option to disable item/fluid rendering in the Reaction Chamber (for those using 100's of them, to prevent lag)
- Stock Export buses (and Advanced IO buses) can now also keep stock of chemicals!
