# Reaction Chamber

<BlockImage id="advanced_ae:reaction_chamber" scale="4"></BlockImage>

The reaction chamber is capable of accelerating chemical reactions by using a catalyst fluid and a great amount of
power. In doing so, reactions that naturally occur can be forced to happen inside the chamber, most of the time with
more efficient results, due to the controlled environment.
